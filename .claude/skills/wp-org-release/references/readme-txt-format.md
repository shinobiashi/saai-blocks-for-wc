## Changelog Format Best Practices

Use a consistent prefix system so users understand what changed:

```
= 2.0.0 =
* Added: New dashboard widget
* Added: Block support for Twenty Twenty-Five theme
* Changed: Renamed settings page to "My Plugin Settings"
* Fixed: Resolved conflict with Yoast SEO plugin
* Removed: Deprecated `my_plugin_legacy_function()` function
* Security: Fixed XSS vulnerability in user input display
```

Prefixes: `Added`, `Changed`, `Fixed`, `Removed`, `Security`

---

## Stable Tag vs. Version

The `Stable tag` in `readme.txt` must match the plugin's `Version:` header AND the SVN tag:

```
readme.txt:        Stable tag: 1.2.0
plugin-file.php:   Version: 1.2.0
SVN tag:           tags/1.2.0/
```

If `Stable tag: trunk`, WordPress.org serves the trunk version — only use this during development.

---

## Tags Recommendations

- Use generic terms, not your brand name
- Max 5 tags shown on the directory page (you can list more but only 5 are displayed)
- No spaces within a tag (use hyphens: `custom-post-type`)
- Check popular existing tags: `https://wordpress.org/plugins/tags/`

Good tags example:
```
Tags: woocommerce, payment, checkout, e-commerce, stripe
```

---

## Screenshot Captions

The `== Screenshots ==` section lists captions that correspond to `screenshot-1.png`, `screenshot-2.png`, etc. in the SVN `/assets/` directory:

```
== Screenshots ==

1. This is the admin settings page.
2. The block editor integration.
3. Front-end display of the widget.
```

Screenshot `screenshot-1.png` shows caption "This is the admin settings page.", and so on.
